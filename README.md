# Capstone-Project
This is a academic project part of my Master's Degree.
The aim is to understand How APAC stock indices react to market contengencies.
I am using R to do the project.
I used YahooFinance to retrieve the data of thirteen stock indices in the APAC region and then converted the data to USD.
